# EMR-Sqoop-RDS

Before starting this project, we have to understand what is EMR and why this one is used.

Amazon Elastic MapReduce (EMR) is an Amazon Web Services (AWS) platform for big data processing and analysis using famous open source tools like Apache Spark, Apache Hive, Apache HBase, Apache Flink and Presto. 

EMR provides scalable, flexible and fast computing over petabyte-sized large data.
